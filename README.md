Instructions for making it running

Please modify the database connection string in appsettings.json to point to an empty database "ForexQuotation": "Server=localhost;Database=ForexQuotation;Integrated Security=true"

To install all packages, please run "npm i rimraf -g" "npm i"

The database tables will be automatically created by running the project in visual studio 2019 (community/professional/enterprise version) and the system will be started
